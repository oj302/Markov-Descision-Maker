# Markov-Descision-Maker
## Description
An agent that finds the optimal action from any given state in a made up dice game using value iteration.

Included in the repository is dice_game.py which holds all of the code for the rules of the game and lets you play the game when run. Agents.py holds the code for the agents which have been desgined to play the game. The most successful and impressive of which being ValueIterationAgent which automatically runs 100 games and averages its score when the Agents file is run.

## Dice Game Rules
* You start with 0 points
* Roll three fair six-sided dice
* Now choose one of the following:

   * Stick, accept the values shown. If two or more dice show the same values, then all of them are flipped upside down: 1 becomes 6, 2 becomes 5, 3 becomes 4, and vice versa. The total is then added to your points and this is your final score.

OR

   * Reroll the dice. You may choose to hold any combination of the dice on the current value shown. Rerolling costs you 1 point â€“ so during the game and perhaps even at the end your score may be negative. You then make this same choice again.

The best possible score for this game is 18 and is achieved by rolling three 1s on the first roll.

The reroll penalty prevents you from rolling forever to get this score. If the value of the current dice is greater than the expected value of rerolling them (accounting for the penalty), then you should stick.

The optimal decision is independent of your current score. It does not matter whether it is your first roll with a current score of 0, or your twentieth roll with a current score of -19 (in which case a positive end score is impossible), in either of these cases if you roll three 6s (which, if you stick, will only add 3 points) then you still expect to get a better end score by rerolling and taking the penalty. Almost any other roll will beat it, so it's still the right choice to maximise your score.
